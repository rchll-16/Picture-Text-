    <p>Falling in love with you was not a choice, but the destiny of my life!
        With every passing moment, I fall in love with you a little more!
        You are the reason I live for. You’re my everything, and I cannot 
        express how much I love you! Thank you for always being there for me, 
        for loving me, and for letting me love you. This is an amazing experience 
        of loving you. All my love is for you. You are the sweetest beginning of a 
        never-ending love story. You are the prince charming and I’m the princess 
        in the story. I may not be the perfect girlfriend, but I know how to love 
        you like no one does and no one will never do. Because I love you more than 
        myself. Even a thousand suns cannot shine brighter than your smile. You 
        light up my life in every possible way. Never stop doing that! Only you can 
        kiss me a thousand times a day and each kiss would feel like the first kiss 
        I ever had in my life. I don’t want the world, I don’t want the skies, I 
        don’t want the moon, I just want you in my share. Love you a lot, my love.
        You are the sweetest surprise in my life. All I want is to be your girl, forever.
        I love the sparkle between us, the faith in our love. You are an amazing partner 
        that everyone wishes to have. I feel lucky that I got you. I love you so much.
        Your love is the reason why my days are so full of colors, my nights are so full 
        of dreams and my life is so full of happiness! Every time I try to keep my heart 
        away from you, it revolts and escapes. My heart finds you and wants to be locked 
        up in you forever! Beb, nothing makes me happier in this world like your silly 
        smile! Since I met you, I haven’t spent a single moment without thinking of you. 
        You are in my thoughts, in my heart, and in my mind always. In your arms, I 
        have found a perfect hiding place for me. I can avoid the rest of the world 
        and still feel like I have everything right here, right in your arms.
        Beb, I love it when I catch you staring at me with those dreamy eyes!
        You still make my heart race just like day 1! I love you! I like how our fingers 
        fit together like the pieces of a puzzle, love! You are the most amazing man I 
        have ever encountered and I am so lucky to have you in my life! I love you!

        happier days to come! Stay blessed! I have seen amazing things, I have known

        deeply and truly. Falling in love with you was not a choice, but the destiny of my life!

        You are the reason I live for. You’re my everything, and I cannot 
        express how much I love you! Thank you for always being there for me, 
        for loving me, and for letting me love you. This is an amazing experience 
        of loving you. All my love is for you. You are the sweetest beginning of a 
        never-ending love story. You are the prince charming and I’m the princess 
        in the story. I may not be the perfect girlfriend, but I know how to love 
        you like no one does and no one will never do. Because I love you more than 
        myself. Even a thousand suns cannot shine brighter than your smile. You 
        light up my life in every possible way. Never stop doing that! Only you can 
        kiss me a thousand times a day and each kiss would feel like the first kiss 
        I ever had in my life. I don’t want the world, I don’t want the skies, I 
        don’t want the moon, I just want you in my share. Love you a lot, my love.
        You are the sweetest surprise in my life. All I want is to be your girl, forever.

        of dreams and my life is so full of happiness! Every time I try to keep my heart 
        away from you, it revolts and escapes. My heart finds you and wants to be locked 
        up in you forever! Beb, nothing makes me happier in this world like your silly 
        smile! Since I met you, I haven’t spent a single moment without thinking of you. 
        You are in my thoughts, in my heart, and in my mind always. In your arms, I 
        have found a perfect hiding place for me. I can avoid the rest of the world 
        and still feel like I have everything right here, right in your arms.
        Beb, I love it when I catch you staring at me with those dreamy eyes!
